# Tilting-Rider

Your home planet of Grass World has been invaded by evil alien penguins and their robotic eggs. All that stands between your planet and total destruction is your floating head. Battle the penguins and their eggs across different worlds, take over their Mothership, and free your planet from their arctic oppression.


Take control of your movement by tilting your phone, and tap towards the enemies to blast them to pieces.

Calibrate your accelerometer to allow for comfortable tilt "neutral" positions.
